Write a class called Converter.

    The user will pass a length and a unit when declaring an object from the classâ€”for example, c = Converter(9,'inches'). 
    The possible units are inches, feet, yards, miles, kilometers, meters, centimeters, and millimeters.
    For each of these units there should be a method that returns the length converted into those units. 
    For example, using the Converter object created above, the user could call c.feet() and should get 0.75 as the result.
