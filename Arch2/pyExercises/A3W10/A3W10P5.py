'''
Python uses the # character to mark the beginning of a comment.
The comment ends at the end of the line containing the # character. In this exercise,
you will create a program that removes all of the comments from a Python source file. Check each line in
the file to determine if a # character is present. If it is then your program should remove all of the
characters from the # character to the end of the line (weâ€™ll ignore the situation where the comment character occurs inside of a string).
Save the modified file using a new name that will be entered by the user. T
he user will also enter the name of the input file. Display an appropriate error message if a problem is encountered while accessing the files.
